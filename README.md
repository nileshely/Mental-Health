**Description:**

The dataset encompasses a comprehensive array of features pertinent to text analysis, sentiment assessment, and psychological metrics, presumably extracted from textual content. It encompasses readability indices such as the Automated Readability Index (ARI), Coleman Liau Index, and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, alongside sentiment analysis scores including sentiment compound, negative, neutral, and positive scores. Moreover, it incorporates indicators related to psychological aspects like economic stress, isolation, substance use, and domestic stress.
